# 1. Download the Project from Github {#download}
First thing's first, we're going to need to download the project files from github. Here's [a download link](https://github.com/pettyjamesm/mammoth-school-sql-intro/archive/master.zip){:target="_blank"}.

# 2. Extract the Project Files {#extract}
Extract the files you just downloaded to your desktop. Some of the projects lessons reference the folder location by the name `mammoth-school-sql-intro` even though the download link will extract as `mammoth-school-sql-intro-master`. You can choose to rename the folder to match the lessons or leave it as-is, just remember to use whatever name you choose when following the lessons.

# 3. Test Your Environment {#verify}
The last thing you'll want to do is verify that your setup is ready to use. To do that, head over to the first guide: [Testing Your Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-29-00-environment-test %}).
